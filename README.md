# Finance-Tracker
This is a personal finance tracker to help you organize your finances.
It can plot a graph of your incomes and expenses using the matplotlib in python, and you can choose the period of time you want to see transactions in.
Pretty useful and making this i learned a lot to be honest.
It makes a .csv file to store the data you provided, and go through all the data and make the graph.
